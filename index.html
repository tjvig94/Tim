    <h2>Hi.</h2>

      music-learning.</p>

    <h3>Pedagogy</h3>
    <p>I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Music Education from the University of New Hampshire.<br />
    I have taught band at all levels, from teaching simply how to make a sound, <br />
    to preparing students for college auditions. <br />
    <br />
    I believe that student musicians learn best by making music as much as possible, <br />
    and by collaborating with fellow musicians.<br /> <br />
    <br />
    <img src="images\browser.png" alt="browser"><br /><br />
    <h3>Design & Development</h3>
    <p>I have a passion for creating websites that have a clean and slick design <br />
      that is both easy to navigate and pleasant to look at. <br /><br />
      I have particular experience in developing websites and apps that allow <br />
      music students to access materials online and connect with their teachers. <br /><br />
      However, I can create any website that will suit your needs.</p>
